# Password Generator

In the digital age, a password generator is an essential tool. Its main purpose is to enhance online security by creating strong, random passwords. By combining letters, numbers, and special characters, password generators output unique and complex passwords that are very difficult to crack. These passwords act as the first line of defence against unauthorized access to sensitive information, protecting personal data, bank accounts, and confidential documents. It's not just convenient but rather necessary for people and institutions to encounter sort of password generator in this age of cyber attacks, which guarantees a bit of mind when the world is more and more interconnected.

## Design

### Website Structure

I wanted to create a website with 3-4 pages, but when I got to the end and saw the finished work, it made more sense to create just one page divided into sections, since the website isn't that big and doesn't have that much content.

The html on my website contains three sections: the password generator section, the saved passwords section and the frequently asked questions section. These sections are one below the other, making the navigation of the website much smoother and more dynamic.

### Wireframes

I created wireframes for mobile and desktop using Figma. Click on the button below to see them.

### Color Scheme

- I used the color `#FCDAD7` in the navigation bar.
- I used the color `#F05244` for the edges of the containers on every page of the website. This color also appears when the user hovers over the buttons and the posters on the main page.
- The gradient in the background is made with the colors `#26174B` and `#FCDAD7`.
- On the buttons I chose `#AB2D8` to be the color.
- The logo has three colors: `#F05244`, `#AB2D8` and `#5E276F`.
